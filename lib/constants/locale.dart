It's a key factor that influences the fermentation process and the characteristics of your bread. The inoculation level percentage affects the fermentation rate, flavor profile, and texture of your sourdough bread. Higher percentages result in a faster and more pronounced fermentation, which can lead to a stronger sour flavor and more open crumb structure. Lower percentages result in a milder flavor and a slower fermentation.
This value is directly affected by ambient temperature; for example, a colder environment will require a stronger fermantation and so a higher inoculation level.''';

It is recommended to avoid basing the bulk fermentation duration on time, as it depends on too many variables; instead, the percentage of volume rise is a more reliable way to measure that that produces more consistent results.
This percentage is directly affected by the ambient temperature; for example, in a warmer environment the dough will need to rise less to be considered ready for shaping.''';
