## How it works

The user provides ambient temperature, final bread desired weight, hydration and salt levels, and gets in return all the relevant data automatically calculated: all the ingredients quantities, the recommended inoculation level and how much should the dough rise during fermentation.

dart run cli/bump_version.dart --increment patch
# Updates the VERSION file using semantic versioning. Supported increment values: patch|minor|major.
```
