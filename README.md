Sourdoc: Your ultimate companion for perfect sourdough - Calculate every essential variable from mixing to fermentation for the ideal sourdough baking experience.  
Available to all web browsers at: [sourdoc.duddu.dev](https://sourdoc.duddu.dev).

## How it works

The user provides ambient temperature, final bread desired weight, hydration and salt levels, and gets in return all the relevant data automatically calculated: all the ingredients quantities, the recommended inoculation level and how much should the dough rise during fermentation.
