# [Sourdoc](https://sourdoc.duddu.dev) 

[Sourdoc](https://sourdoc.duddu.dev) is a tool for sourdough bakers to calculate all the variables needed for a perfect dough, from mixing to fermentation.

## How it works

The user provides ambient temperature, final bread desired weight, hydration and salt levels, and gets in return all the relevant data automatically calculated: all the ingredients quantities, the recommended inoculation level and how much should the dough rise during fermentation.
